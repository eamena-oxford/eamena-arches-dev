## BU process
> step-by-step BU procedure from the user-side


- choose a short and self-explanatory name for your **BU files**, for example, the name of `gridcell-subpart-name` (ex: `E61N31-23-Bijan.xlsx`)

- put the BUs worksheets on a **folder** named YYYY-MM-DD-Name (ex: 2021-11-23-Bijan). If you run various BUs processes the same day, you will have to name your folders with different suffixes (ex: 2021-11-22-Bijan, 2021-11-22a-Bijan)

- put these folders on **your OneDrive**, and send a Slack message to the DB Manager with the **name of the BUs files** and the **link to this folder** 

- if **the BU does not work**, because there are errors, the DB Manager will send you an error report in the form of a error JSON file named in the same way as your BU files (ex: [`E61N31-22-Bijan.json`](https://github.com/eamena-oxford/eamena-arches-dev/blob/main/output/bulk/Bulks/2021-11-21-Bijan/E61N31-21-Bijan.json))

  - following the recommendations of the error JSON file, you will have to correct the content of your file. Once done, change the name of your file to something explicit, for example like adding `-rev` at the end of the file name (ex: `E61N31-22-Bijan.xlsx` -> `E61N31-22-Bijan-rev.xlsx`)

- if **the BU works**, the DB Manager will send you a confirmation, and the JSON output will be uploaded into the **same OneDrive folder** as your BUs worksheets 

  - if you ask to we will send you a [BU summary](https://github.com/eamena-oxford/eamena-arches-dev/blob/main/output/bulk/BU.md#bu-summary) in the form of a JSON file named in the same way as your BU files and `-sum` (ex: [`E61N31-22-Bijan-rev-sum.json`](https://github.com/eamena-oxford/eamena-arches-dev/blob/main/output/bulk/Bulks/2021-11-21-Bijan/E61N31-21-Bijan-rev-sum.json))

- once you received the confirmation that your BU has been uploaded into the DB, **move your BU sheet into an archives folder**

## BU summary
> After a successfull BU, render a short summary for the user

Once the BU process complete, a resume can be displayed with a python command[^1]. The result is copied/pasted in a JSON file. A S&R allows to convert the UUID into an URL[^2]
