"Widgets are data entry helpers for each node that collects information; it's"
" often easier to pick a date from a calendar than to type it in, for "
"example. Generally, the data type of the node will determine which Widget "
"template is used. However, in some cases you will have a choice: For "
"example, in the case of a <code>concept</code> node, you can choose a "
"dropdown menu or a set of radio buttons. Similarly, for a "
"<code>string</code> node you can choose a basic text box or a rich text "
"editor."
